# Week 1 – Pandas Data Exploration and Data Cleaning

## Objective

Perform basic data exploration and cleaning using Pandas on a shopping dataset.

## Dataset Selection

The Kaggle dataset provided multiple CSV files representing different product categories.

The **Combined_dataset.csv** file was selected because it consolidates all product categories into a single dataset, making it suitable for comprehensive analysis.

## Steps Performed

* Loaded the dataset using Pandas
* Explored the dataset using head(), tail(), shape, columns, info(), and describe()
* Identified missing values
* Handled missing data using fillna() and dropna()
* Removed duplicate records
* Filtered rows and selected relevant columns
* Created a derived column for demonstration purposes
* Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## Output

* Cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_shopping_data.csv
* Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis steps

# Week 2 – SQL Sales Data Analysis

## Objective

Analyze sales data using SQL with filtering, aggregation, sorting, business queries, and data validation techniques.

## Dataset

Superstore Sales Dataset

## Tasks Performed

### Data Exploration

* Examined table schema and sample records
* Identified unique categories, cities, and states
* Calculated row counts and unique orders

### Filtering and Analysis

* Applied filters using WHERE clauses
* Analyzed data by region, category, sales, profit, and date ranges

### Aggregations

* Used GROUP BY with SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT()
* Calculated category-wise sales, quantity, and profit metrics

### Ranking and Sorting

* Identified top and bottom products by sales
* Identified top and bottom products by profit
* Ranked states and categories by total sales

### Business Use Cases

* Monthly sales trend analysis
* Top customers by sales
* Top customers by profit
* Duplicate order analysis

### Data Validation

* Verified row counts
* Checked missing values
* Validated shipping dates against order dates
* Reviewed profit and discount ranges

## Tools Used

* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* SQL

## Output

* SQL analysis script
* Query results
